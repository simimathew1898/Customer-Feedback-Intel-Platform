# Customer Feedback Intelligence Platform

This project simulates and analyzes customer feedback from multiple channels including app reviews, surveys, and chat logs. It processes incoming feedback using NLP techniques to detect sentiment and common themes, then visualizes the results through an interactive dashboard.

The main goal is to build an end-to-end data engineering pipeline that demonstrates real-time data ingestion, transformation, analysis, and insight delivery.

## Tech Stack

- **Python** – scripting and NLP processing
- **Faker** – to generate realistic feedback data
- **VADER / BERT** – for sentiment analysis
- **Apache Airflow (planned)** – orchestration
- **Snowflake / BigQuery (planned)** – data warehouse
- **Streamlit** – for dashboarding
- **GitHub Actions** – for CI/CD automation

## Project Roadmap

- [x] Set up project repo and folder structure
- [ ] Generate simulated customer feedback
- [ ] Build sentiment analysis pipeline (VADER → BERT)
- [ ] Create dashboard with real-time metrics
- [ ] Add alerting for negative sentiment spikes
- [ ] Connect to Snowflake / BigQuery for storage
- [ ] Automate pipeline with GitHub Actions and Airflow

## Motivation

Customer feedback is rich with insights but often ignored until it's too late. This project focuses on processing that data automatically, with a secure and scalable pipeline that could be useful in real-world customer support, product improvement, and experience monitoring.
